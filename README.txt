SVG NOTES:
	EXPORT SVGS IN 1.0, not 1.1, or at least try to, because
	it is very important that the 'fill' attribute is in the 
	<g> element(s), not the <svg> element


	Also, in order to compile the images directory run the following python command
		python ./compiler.py
	
	
	if you want a specific color that wont be affected by the palette, add it to the lines svg
