This is a reference file for layering on the Chimera model

[Body Z-Order]

 - Hair Front

 - Horns - random roll for whether or not horns are on



 - Eyes

 - Mouth

 - Nose

 - Head

 - Ears


 
 - Shoulders
 
 - Hands

 - Arms

 - Neck

 - Torso


 
 = Legs =    

 - Hips	    - Full Conversion*

 - Feet



 - Hair Back



 - Tail (chance of not displaying)

 - Wings (chance of not displaying)
 
============================


* Legs can be either Hips+Feet or Full Conversion. 
The reason is because legs like Naga tails and Centaurs wouldn't be able to fit the original Hips+Feet setup, so instead full conversion fully replaces the legs portion as a one piece, unique part.



Mask Z-Order

 - Line - Is the lineart of the body piece, laid on top of everything for that part
 
 - color - hair color
 
 - iris  - colored part of the eye
 - sclera - the stuff around it, not sure if unnecessary detail, but I thought of separating it anyway.

 - fur2 - Secondary fur color
 - fur1 - Primary fur color




 - skin2 - Secondary skin color, used for skin things on top of the base one like marks or soft scales
 - scales - Actually meant for stuff that didn't fit in skin2 and skin1, so it is put on top of everything. Could actually be named scales, because of what it wouldn't up being used for..not sure.
 - skin1 - Primary skin color, is the base human skin stuff
